# Pychain

### A simple application that mimicks the behavior of a blockchain using python classes and streamlit to render all information on the page.

---
#### The user can enter in the sender, receiver, and amount.  After hitting "Add Block" the new block is displayed on the chain, and blocks can be explored on the left-hand sidebar.

#### A simple button is rendered at the bottom which lets you know that the blockchain is functional.
